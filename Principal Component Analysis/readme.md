Overview
This Python script performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a set of tech stocks to extract key factors driving the stock returns. The first principal component (PC1) is used to create a basic trading strategy, with z-scores derived from the rolling mean and standard deviation of PC1. The strategy generates buy/sell signals based on defined thresholds, and the script compares the performance of this strategy with the overall market returns.
Requirements
The script requires the following Python packages:
* numpy
* pandas
* yfinance
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* xlwings

How It Works
1. Downloading Data:
    * Historical stock data for Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA) is downloaded using yfinance.
2. Data Preprocessing:
    * Daily percentage returns are calculated and standardized for each stock.
3. PCA Application:
    * PCA is applied to the standardized returns to identify the principal components (PCs) that explain the most variance in the data. The explained variance ratios are plotted to visualize the contribution of each PC.
4. Trading Strategy:
    * The first principal component (PC1) is extracted and used to calculate rolling mean and standard deviation.
    * Z-scores are computed for PC1, and trading signals are generated:
        * Long Position (Buy) when the z-score of PC1 is below -1.
        * Short Position (Sell) when the z-score of PC1 is above +1.
    * The positions are lagged by one day to simulate actual trading.
5. Performance Calculation:
    * Strategy returns are computed based on the stock returns and trading positions.
    * Cumulative returns for both the strategy and the market average are calculated.
6. Visualization:
    * Two key visualizations are included:
        1. Explained Variance by Principal Components: Bar chart showing the variance explained by each PC.
        2. Cumulative Returns: Line chart comparing the cumulative returns of the PCA-based strategy versus the market.
Key Variables
* entry_threshold: The z-score threshold to trigger a long position (default: -1.0).
* exit_threshold: The z-score threshold to close the position (default: 0.0).
* window: Rolling window size for calculating mean and standard deviation (default: 30 days).
Output
* Principal Component DataFrame (pc_df): Displays the principal component loadings for each stock.
* Strategy Performance: The final cumulative returns of the PCA-based strategy and market returns are printed and displayed using xlwings.
* Visualizations: Plots are generated to show the ratio of explained variance by the principal components and the cumulative returns of the strategy compared to the market.
How to Run
1. Download historical stock data for the specified tickers (Apple, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia).
2. The script calculates daily percentage returns, standardizes them, and applies PCA.
3. Based on the z-scores of the first principal component (PC1), the script generates buy/sell signals.
4. Cumulative strategy returns are compared to the market and plotted.
Example of Results:
* A bar chart showing the percentage of explained variance by each principal component.
* A cumulative return plot showing the performance of the strategy compared to the average market return.
Notes:
* xlwings is used to display intermediate data and the final results in Excel for further analysis.
* The strategy assumes daily rebalancing and no transaction costs. To make the strategy more robust, consider adding transaction costs and slippage.
Limitations
* The script uses a simplified approach to signal generation based on the first principal component and z-scores. It doesn't account for transaction costs, risk management, or advanced filtering techniques, which are important in a live trading environment.
* The PCA approach assumes stationarity and that historical price movements can predict future returns, which may not always hold in real markets.
